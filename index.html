				<h2>What is Algorithms ?</h2>
			</header>
			<div class="content">
				<p>You use code to tell a computer what to do. Before you write code you need an algorithm. <br />

					<strong>An algorithm is a list of rules to follow in order to solve a problem.</strong> <br />

					Algorithms need to have their steps in the right order. Think about an algorithm for getting dressed
					in the morning. What if you put on your coat before your jumper? Your jumper would be on top of your
					coat and that would be silly! When you write an algorithm the order of the instructions is very
					important. <br />

					<strong>Watch this video and find out what algorithms are.</strong>

				<p><strong>I need to make a cake</strong> <br />
					The algorithm here is a cake recipe. You can find the algorithm to solve this problem in a cookbook!
				</p>
				<span class="image main"><img src="images/pancake.jpg" alt="" /></span>

				<p><strong>I can't find the park</strong> <br />

					The algorithm you need is a set of directions to get to the park. There might be different ways to
					the park so you can have different algorithms.

				<p><strong>I need to build a toy </strong> <br />
					The algorithm to follow here is the list of instructions that tell you how to make the toy.

				<h2>Big O Notation</h2>
			</header>
			<div class="content">
				<p><strong>Big O notation</strong> is a mathematical notation that describes the
					limiting behavior of a function when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity. ...
					In computer science, big O notation is used to classify algorithms according to how their run time
					or space requirements grow as the input size grows.</p>

						<h3>Time complexity</h3>
						<p>Time complexity is the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run, as a function of the
							length of the input. It measures the time taken to execute each statement of code in an
							algorithm.</p>

						<h3>Space complexity</h3>
						<p>Space complexity of an algorithm or a computer program is the amount of memory space
							required to solve an instance of the computational problem as a function of characteristics
							of the input. It is the memory required by an algorithm until it executes completely.</p>

				<h2>Conditional Statements</h2>
			</header>
			<div class="content">
				<p><strong>if/else statements</strong> executes a block of code if a specified condition is true. If the
					condition is false, another block of code can be executed. The if/else statement is a part
					of JavaScript's "Conditional" Statements, which are used to perform different actions based
					on different conditions.</p>

				<h2>Sorting Algorithms</h2>
			</header>
			<div class="content">
				<p>In computer science, <strong>a sorting algorithm</strong> is an algorithm that
					puts elements of a list in a certain order. The most frequently used orders are numerical order and
					lexicographical order. Efficient sorting is important for optimizing the efficiency of other
					algorithms that require input data to be in sorted lists.</p>

				<p>Some Common Sorting Algorithms
					Some of the most common sorting algorithms are:
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Bucket Sort</li>
					<li>Selection Sort</li>
					<li>Bubble Sort</li>
					<li>Insertion Sort</li>
					<li>Merge Sort</li>
					<li>Quick Sort</li>

				<h2>Searching Algorithms</h2>
			</header>
			<div class="content">
				<p>Searching Algorithms are designed to check for an element or retrieve an element from any data
					structure where it is stored. Based on the type of search operation, these algorithms are generally
					classified into two categories: <br /><br />

					Sequential Search: In this, the list or array is traversed sequentially and every element is
					checked. For example: Linear Search.<br />
					Interval Search: These algorithms are specifically designed for searching in sorted data-structures.
					These type of searching algorithms are much more efficient than Linear Search as they repeatedly
					target the center of the search structure and divide the search space in half. For Example: Binary
					Search.</p>
